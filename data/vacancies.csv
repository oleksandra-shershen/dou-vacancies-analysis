Middle Python Developer in Test (Apps),https://jobs.dou.ua/companies/ajax-systems/vacancies/270831/,Ajax Systems,"About project:Ajax is an ecosystem whose work is impossible without high-quality and easy-to-use applications. Manual testers and the automation team are responsible for the operation of this part of the Ajax world. They have just developed a framework that allows you to recreate any situation imaginable by our QA. We are testing on iOS / AOS platforms using Appium.What is a technically interesting vacancy?:The project is actively developing, so you can influence its outcome at the start. Today, the basic functionality has been developed, which is enough to write tests, but there is a large area of uncovered cases, for the automation of which it is necessary to develop new functionality of the framework.Responsibilities:Develop, maintain, and own automated testing frameworks;Design and implement test scripts (Python3, pytest);Analyse results of the test runs (Allure);Writting bug reports of found issues and support their life cycle;Recommends improvements to the testing processes to create efficiencies;Estimates effort required for own work;Required skills:2+ years of experience writing and executing tests in Python3;Strong knowledge of software QA methodologies, tools and processes;Experience with CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, Bitbucket, etc.);Experience in working with bug trackers;Knowledge UNIX/Linux OS;Knowledge of client server architecture;Nice-to-Have Skills:Experience in automation GUI-testing;Experience with gRPC;",–ö–∏—ó–≤,"Python, gRPC, Bitbucket, Jenkins, pytest",1-3
